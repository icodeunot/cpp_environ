# cpp_environ
A collection of learning material and small projects.

As I go through the WGU course C867 and read Bjarne Stroustrup's book, I am adding labs from the end of the chapters.
These labs are not required for the course, and at first I did not want to complete them, but they are really beneficial. 
As of 2/22/2022 I am stuck halfway in between understanding pointers and being completely lost with them. 
Going back to the beginning of the c++ basics and knocking out these labs is making me a stronger coder, 
which is hard because I am also a full time accountant in a busy publich tax firm, a husband, and a father of 4 kids.

Life is busy, but when I get a program to build and run... it's just a feeling I have been looking for all my life.
